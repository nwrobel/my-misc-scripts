To use:

- Copy this whole "Windows Defender Toggle" folder to somewhere on the target machine (suggested: to Program Files)
- Move/copy the shortcuts to somewhere you can easily use them from
- Dbl-click either one to toggle Win Defneder Real-time protection

If issues, ensure: 
- the shortcut is running as an admin
- that the execution policy in Powershell is 'unrestricted'
