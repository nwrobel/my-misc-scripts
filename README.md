# my-misc-scripts
This repo contains miscellaneous scripts I've written. They are generally simple one-off scripts written for a single purpose or task for me. 

Each of these scripts are currently too small to place in their own repo. If any of these scripts are developed into a larger project, they will be grouped together and moved to another more suitable repo for a specific purpose.
